# Teardrop Camper Design Requirements

## Project Goal
Design a 3D model of a teardrop camper similar to the Cedar Ridge Vega Lite using OpenSCAD, focusing on accurate dimensions, modular components, and realistic construction details.

## Target Specifications (Based on Cedar Ridge Vega Lite)

### Overall Dimensions
- **Length**: 13 feet (3.96m) - hitch to tail
- **Width**: 85 inches (2.16m) - maximum body width  
- **Height**: 79 inches (2.01m) - to roof rack
- **Weight**: Target under 1,000 lbs (design consideration)
- **Ground Clearance**: 12-15 inches (adjustable)

### Interior Cabin
- **Sleeping Area**: 58" × 78" (1.47m × 1.98m) queen mattress
- **Interior Height**: 46 inches (1.17m) - cannot stand
- **Storage Volume**: 17 cubic feet minimum
- **Access**: Dual doors 30" × 36" each

### Construction Requirements
- **No wood construction**: Modern composite approach
- **Weather sealed**: All-weather capability
- **Lightweight**: Composite and HDPE materials
- **Modular design**: Easy assembly/disassembly in 3D model
